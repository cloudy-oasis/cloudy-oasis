- 👋 Hi, I’m Cloudy Oasis ! I speak English and French, I'm a CS student
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, video games, languages, and memes :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and a bit of Python, a weird duo
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on random projects, I'm a bit all over the place so I don't exactly know what yet
- 🫥 Most of my repos are private, not because I like closed-source (I don't, it sucks), just because I get self-conscious otherwise.
- 💞 I would like to collaborate with my friends but you don't have to be a friend to come by and say hello !
- 📫 How to reach me : please schedule a meeting in the Trans Agenda, you should've gotten a pamphlet containing instructions during the last Trans Lobby Hackaton. If you weren't present, or if you haven't gotten the pamphlet, please send me a PR.

Hello people, this is the Narrator speaking. While Cloudy isn't certain this file is amazing, she wasn't sure whether to keep the original format. Hopefully you don't mind.  
Oh, also, please put back the sensitive data. Have a nice stay !
